## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
- **IDELayout Foundation**: Build upon the existing resizable panel system from Story 3.3 - maintain existing layout functionality while enhancing visual design
- **Terminal Integration**: Enhance the terminal implementation from Story 3.6 with visual improvements and tab support - preserve existing WebSocket functionality
- **File Operations**: Maintain compatibility with existing file browser and code viewer from Stories 3.4 and 3.5 - replace CodeViewer with enhanced CodeEditor
- **Service Architecture**: Integrate with the refactored backend services from Story 3.7 - ensure all new components work with existing service layer

### Design System Structure
Based on modern UI/UX patterns, implement the following design token structure:
- **Color System**: Primary (blue), Secondary (purple), Semantic (success/warning/error/info), Neutral palette
- **Typography Scale**: xs(0.75rem) to 2xl(1.5rem) with tight/normal/relaxed line heights
- **Spacing System**: 0.5(0.125rem) to 12(3rem) following 8px grid
- **Border Radius**: sm(0.125rem) to xl(0.75rem) for consistent component styling

### Component Library Architecture
New UI components to be created in `apps/web/app/components/ui/`:
- **Button**: Variants (primary/secondary/outline/ghost), sizes (sm/md/lg), loading states
- **Card**: Variants (elevated/outlined/filled), configurable padding
- **Input**: Enhanced validation states, visual feedback, focus indicators
- **LoadingSkeleton**: Configurable shapes for different content types

### Code Editor Integration
- **Technology Choice**: Prism.js for lightweight syntax highlighting or Monaco Editor for advanced features
- **Language Support**: TypeScript, JavaScript, JSX, CSS, JSON, Markdown
- **Features**: Line numbers, code folding, minimap, search/replace
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for large files, virtual scrolling for performance
